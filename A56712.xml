            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis with all manner of Acknowledgment that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yours yeſterday, but muſt aſſure you, That the Thoughts you have of the preſent Juncture, are very different from thoſe we have here; and that only to repeat them would be looked upon as a kind of Hereſy: For we cannot imagine, how any other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can be given to our Zeal, than a ſincere and ardent Deſire for the Sitting of the Parliament, that Traytors might be brought to condign Puniſhment, that the Plot might be deſtroyed, and Popery rooted out; ſo long as which is in being, we cannot think there is any Security for the King's Perſon, and the Proteſtant Religion, but that They, our Lives, and Liberties, are in continual Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103028:2"/>
And we are very much miſtaken by thoſe who charge us with being jealous of the King's Authority, and as if We ſuſpected he had a Deſign of depriving us of our Privileges. Far from that, we agree with you, That never any Nation enjoyed a more gracious Prince; and all the Paces and Motions we have made, were to no other intent, than that His Life and Government might be ſecured, and that we might be bleſſed with, and ſtill enjoy under his Reign, that Happineſs, and flouriſhing Condition, which made us envied by all our Neighbour Nations, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be under a Scepter, whoſe Subjects are happier than other Sovereign's. We could not think there was any better Means for the Securing to us this Bleſſing, than the Sitting of the Parliament, who ſo zealouſly took in hand the deſtroying the Enemies of His Throne and Religion. And ſuch as blame us for being deſirous of having it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, are like thoſe who ſhould find fault with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who ſeeing their Father attacqued, and in Danger, and ſuch of their Elder Brothers, as were armed, capable, and paſſionately bent to prevent his Ruine, by cutting off his Enemies, ſhould beg of him, that they might have leave to purſue their Point, and procure his, and the whole Families Safety, by the deſtruction of thoſe who aimed at nothing but its Fall.</p>
            <p>If ſuch a Care was faulty in ſuch Children, then I muſt confeſs, we are very criminal: But I ſhall leave you to judg of that, and ſhall only beg, that you would furniſh me with all poſſible Occaſions of ſhewing how ſenſible I am of your Favours, and making appear the Paſſion and Reſpect, with which I am,</p>
            <closer>
